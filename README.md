# Decentralized Energy Trading Platform

## Project Description
A blockchain-based platform that enables peer-to-peer energy trading between producers and consumers. This smart contract allows renewable energy producers to sell their excess energy directly to consumers without intermediaries, creating a more efficient and transparent energy market.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to democratize energy distribution by leveraging blockchain technology to:
- Empower individual energy producers (especially renewable energy sources)
- Reduce energy costs for consumers
- Increase grid efficiency by localizing energy distribution
- Promote sustainable energy practices through transparent trading

## Key Features
1. **Energy Offer Creation**: Producers can list their excess energy for sale.
2. **Energy Purchase**: Consumers can buy energy directly from producers.
3. **Transparent Transactions**: All trades are recorded on the blockchain.
4. **Secure Payments**: Automatic payment processing upon energy purchase.
5. **Offer Management**: Producers can cancel their offers if needed.

## Future Scope
- Integration with IoT devices for automatic energy measurement.
- Implementation of energy tokenization for fractional trading.
- Addition of a reputation system for participants.
- Development of a frontend interface for user-friendly interaction.
- Expansion to support different energy types (solar, wind, etc.).
- Integration with existing energy grids for seamless operation.
- Implementation of smart pricing algorithms based on demand.
